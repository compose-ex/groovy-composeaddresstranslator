# Groovy ComposeAddressTranslator

This is a Groovy/Java class for handling Scylla/Cassandra style address
translation when connecting to Compose Scylla deployments. The core class
is the same as the [Java ComposeAddressTranslator](https://github.com/compose-ex/java-composeaddresstranslator)
 just reframed here in a Groovy context as an example.
